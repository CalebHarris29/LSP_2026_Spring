AI Prompts — Assignment 3

Prompt 1
Refactor my Assignment 2 ETL pipeline into a modular, object-oriented design while preserving the exact same input/output behavior, transformation order, error handling, and relative file paths. The redesign must separate responsibilities into clear classes and include Javadocs for all public classes and methods.


Prompt 2
Design a transformation pipeline using a Transformer<T> interface (Strategy pattern) and implement each business rule as a separate class to demonstrate polymorphism while maintaining the same rule order as HW2.


Prompt 3
Create immutable Product and TransformedProduct model classes, where TransformedProduct extends Product to demonstrate inheritance and clean separation between input data and output-specific fields.


Prompt 4
Provide an Eclipse-friendly project structure using a plain src folder, specifying package organization, required documentation files, and a step-by-step build plan to ensure the Assignment 3 implementation runs successfully.
